Postgresql is running locally.

Connection string to the `gator` database is: ` psql "postgres://postgres:<password>@localhost:5433/gator"`
Password is my linux user pw. Somehow it was not changed successfully with the command `sudo passwd postgres`.

Connect to database vie `psql`: `sudo -u postgres psql`
